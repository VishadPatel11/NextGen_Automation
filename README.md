# NextGen_Automation

This is a Cucumber-selenium Framework of Automation. It will run in a BDD style of scripting and is 100% working.
The examples listed are fake data and can be replaced with any URL or other data you would like. 


After Installing run the testRunner file via an IDE(i used IntelliJ)to see the chrome browser open up and run through a simple login. You will need to update the Login url and credentials in the Configurations.properties file to make sure it hits the url you intend to hit.
